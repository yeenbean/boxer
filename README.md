Instantly launch any operating system or Docker image from your terminal. No installation required - just add a single function to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

## Key Features

* Launches an interactive Docker container running the specified OS or image
* Automatically removes the container after use
* Includes a bind mount to your current working directory in `/host`
* No additional software required
* Probably works with `podman` using an alias (untested)

‚ö†Ô∏è *`boxer` always pulls the latest version of an image. At this time, you cannot specify a tag for an image.* ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Setup

```bash
boxer() {
  docker run -it --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/host --hostname boxer-"$1" "$1":latest "${@:2}"
}
```
